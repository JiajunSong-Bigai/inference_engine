# Inference Engine (Designed for Geometry Theorem Proving)

## Why do we need one?

Geometry objects has properties that databases normally don't have, such as symmetry in terms of points construction and transitivity.

As a result, we implement an inference engine that are designed for geometry theorem proving.
